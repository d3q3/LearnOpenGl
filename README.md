Learn OpenGL in JavaScript

A good book on OpenGL together with tutorials can be found at [LearnOpenGl](http://www.learnOpenGl.com). The source code of the tutorials is writen in C++. For a number of those you will find here the same programs, now written in JavaScript code. These OpenGL programs make use of WebGL2. The code is first written in Typescript, a typed version of javascript and then transpiled to ES6 javascript.

The source can of course be downloaded from this site. 

The result of the programs in the browser can be found [at this github site](http://d3q3.github.io/LearnOpenGl). Of course your browser must support WebGl2. This is done by Google Chrome and by the latest versions of Microsoft Edge.

For the documentation of the process of creating these files see [drikus.net](http://www.drikus.net/ict/openGL/Learn/introduction.html).
